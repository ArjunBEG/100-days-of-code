### Day 1: May 26, 2020
##### Vue `<transition>` as part of a CodePen challenge

**Today's Progress**: Participated in the 4th part of CodePen's May 2020 challenge, [Vue Transitions](https://codepen.io/challenges/2020/may/4), so created an Alan Sugar firing list.

**Thoughts:** I only really know as much as CSS transitions and keyframes. I'd really like to learn more web animation but not sure where to start. Check out my [tweet](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1265052767850237954). But this was a good first insight into Vue transitions and it was also nice that I'm already familiar with Vue.js.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020
##### Neumorphic Design

**Today's Progress**: I've recently been fascinated with neumorphic design, so I went and learned how to create neumorpic components.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed doing this. I created several CodePen pens and I wrote a blog to further my understanding. Even though neumorphic design never really took off, I probably won't use or recommend it commercially, however I will definitely use it when creating little neat CodePens.

### Day 3: May 28, 2020
##### Union Jack flag and learning anime.js

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a little CodePen of the Union Jack flag and start learning anime.js

**Thoughts:** The Union Jack flag was interesting because it allowed me to think of how the flag should be structured. I ultimtaely ended up using simple blocks for the red England flag, then furthering my understanding of `linear-gradient` with the Scottish and Northern Ireland flag. I also began learning anime.js for web animation which I hope to be continuing for 4-5 days.

### Day 4: May 29, 2020
##### Web animation - anime.js and GSAP

**Today's Progress**: I began learning anime.js yesterday and sadly we did not get on, so I started over with GSAP

**Thoughts:** Learning GSAP was really fun, I began by making a simple spinning smiley face animation on CodePen. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong with myself and anime.js but hopefully I can revisit it later and try again. But for now, I'm impressed with GSAP! I was curious as to whether other people preferred anime.js or GSAP, so I created a [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1266140324767899648).

### Day 5: May 30, 2020
##### Web animation - GSAP

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with GSAP today, a little lost on ideas and felt a bit demotivated

**Thoughts:** I've been struggling with web animation to be honest, in the sense of - I feel idealess, had a few 'gotcha' moments with timing, messy JS and just feeling like I'm in the right vibe for web animation, it's more of a designer job. Anywho, I'm determined to carry on because I am genuinely interested in learning more and improving my web animation skills.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020
##### Web animation - GSAP

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Day/Night GSAP animation, wasn't particularly happy with myself

**Thoughts:** I've been feeling a bit deflated with my progression on web animation. I wasn't happy with where my skills were. I had to remind myself that it's OK, it will take time, I just need to keep creating lots of animations and eventually my understanding will get there, a very similar approach to how I learned CSS. I've decided to take a little break from web animation and move onto to something else and revisit it in a week or two, hopefully in that time I may discover some free courses and/or more inspirational ideas.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020
##### Neumorphic design

**Today's Progress**: Resumed on my neumorphic design CodePen and collection

**Thoughts:** I decided to take a break from animation today and focus on a few more neumorphic element ideas of mine. I created an analogue and digital clock and various loaders. Looking to resume animation tomorrow with the new CodePen challenge on GSAP.

### Day 8: June 2, 2020
##### GSAP Sequencing Animation

**Today's Progress**: Revisted web animation with CodePen's GSAP Sequencing challenge and watched animation tutorials

**Thoughts:** Interesting day. Took the opportunity to look at what others had submitted for their GSAP sequencing animation CodePen challenge, which inspired me to revisit animation ealrier than expected. Watched a few tutorials on GSAP, reading documentation is OK, but watching a tutorial, watching someone actually do is where it's at! Started an airplane CodePen animation that I hope to resume tomorrow with new things I've learned.

### Day 9: June 3, 2020
##### GSAP Sequencing Animation & GSAP Morph SVG

**Today's Progress**: Resumed on my airplane sequence animation to look for improvements and tried out GSAP's Morph SVG plugin

**Thoughts:** Worked on looking into easing and looking at how I could make the plane look more realistic. Also took the opportunity to watch more GSAP videos on topics I can use later and I created a CodePen to practise using GSAP's Morph SVG plugin.

### Day 10: June 4, 2020
##### Alternative JS & CSS Libraries

**Today's Progress**: Researched into lots of unusual, obscure JS and CSS libraries

**Thoughts:** Decided to take a break from actually creating something today, so I played around with lots of different JS & CSS libraries and created CodePen collections to share with others and reference later. My particular favourites were Particles.js, Rough.js and Softripple.js. I also spent some time going through Dribbble as I need some ideas to start improving [ellaparsons.design](https://ellaparsons.design).

### Day 11: June 5, 2020
##### Adding a portfolio page to ellaparsons.design

**Today's Progress**: Spent today adding a portfolio page to ellaparsons.design to better ready her for her graphic designer job interviews

**Thoughts:** Wanted to make sure the UI was really good so researched into different types of 'cards' I could style. Eventually found one that I spun off into my own that matched the rest of the site. Also tidied up some HTML, CSS & JS/TS.

### Day 12: June 6, 2020
##### Purchased CodePen PRO

**Today's Progress**: Spent today playing around with the features included in CodePen PRO

**Thoughts:** CodePen PRO was definitely worth the investment, I will make good use out of the features it provides! Plus I get a cool "PRO" badge 😎.

### Day 13: June 7, 2020
##### Adding avatars to ellaparsons.design and fixing CSS

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of time was available to me today, but with the time I had, I added neat, little avatars to ellaparsons.design

**Thoughts:** The avatars were quite easy to make with the memojis coming from Apple. I also fixed some CSS bugs with the wreath on the homepage and the portfolio cards I created on [Day 11](#day-11-june-5-2020).

### Day 14: June 8, 2020
##### Re-architect blog with Nuxt Content

**Today's Progress**: My blog was my own implmentation of markdown embedded inside Vue. It was rushed when I did then a few months ago and have been putting off refactoring it.

**Thoughts:** I first looked at frontmatter-makrdown-loader package, but after many failed attempts and searching through its GitHub issues, I finally found my answer "Don't use this package, use Nuxt Content instead". 😨 I looked into Nuxt Content and started implementing it. I struggled fetching the markdown files because the documentation on this particular section, but I neglected to thoroughly read the homepage: there was an embedded Code Sandbox with the solution to fetch markdown files... That's it for the day I think.

### Day 15: June 9, 2020
##### Created an awful CodePen for #NoPreviewHtmlCss

**Today's Progress**: A few days ago, I created a challenge called #NoPreviewHtmlCss on Twitter and decided to take part in my own challenge.

**Thoughts:** The aim is to create something using HTML & CSS but you can't look at the preview until you are done (so you're coding blind). This was my attempt, I'm not proud 🤣. That being said, it was picked by CodePen and showcased on the homepage.

### Day 16: June 10, 2020
##### Resumed re-architect blog with Nuxt Content

**Today's Progress**: Hit a very strange thing with dates in JS and YAML...

**Thoughts:** This is going to be a long explanation, so sit back and relax:

I had this frontmatter in my blogs with the `date` in the YAML date format (13<sup>th</sup> June 2020).

![Day 16 image](img/day-16-a.png)

I then had a `articleDate()` function to fetch the articles to display on my blog list page, that worked fine. I then wanted to display the date of the blog, so I created a function to format each date with date-fn.

![Day 16 image](img/day-16-b.png)

Here's the interesting thing, navigating to `localhost/blog/` worked perfectly 👌, but navigating to `localhost/blog` (no trailing slash), threw and error...

![Day 16 image](img/day-16-c.png)

I knew it was a date issue, so I changed my code to output the raw date in collected from the blogs, here is what happened. (left: no trailing slash, right: trailing slash):

![Day 16 image](img/day-16-d.png)

`/blog/` was outputting the expected output, a Date object, but `/blog` was outputting an ISO-8601 format... After hours of digging around and no progress, I decided to write my own fix, this does not fix what is returned, but this fixes the original `articleDate()` function:

![Day 16 image](img/day-16-e.png)

This will get the date from the blog, parse it as a string, then reparse it as a date, seems redundant for the `/blog/` URL, but it fixes the `/blog` URL, so I think it's worth it! It means now if there's a trailing slash or not, it still works! 😁😎

### Day 17: June 11, 2020
##### Web presence and blog open graph images

**Today's Progress**: Resumed on my blog by improving my web presence and creating a unique open graph for each blog post

**Thoughts:** Working on my website's metadata is always interesting. I learned about the `article` og meta tag with options such as `article:author` and `article:published_time`.

### Day 18: June 12, 2020
##### Close to finishing rearchitecting and helped a friend sell his first website!

**Today's Progress**: My blog rearchitecture is almost finished and ready to be merged into master. Just a few minor additions. Helped [Devin Ford](https://twitter.com/devinDford) sell his first ever website!

**Thoughts:** I'm pleased with my blog improvement, finally getting markdown implemented will be so much more beneficial in the long run. [Devin](https://twitter.com/devinDford) approached me requesting help by taking a look and providing feedback on a website he created for his first client. I provided feedback on how the HTML, CSS & accessibility could be improved and was really pleased to know that the client agreed to purchase the website!

### Day 19: June 13, 2020
##### Blog improvement

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of coding time available to me today, so I added a few tweaks to my blog.

**Thoughts:** A good article has a clear, well formatted published date, some tags that may be relevant to the article and some links so other can share the article on social media. I added these today.

### Day 20: June 14, 2020
##### Finally finished implenting Nuxt Content into my blog and joined [DEV.to](https://dev.to/jackdomleo7)!

**Today's Progress**: Really happy to have merged my Nuxt Content branch into master, this is a big step into simplifying my blog and make writing easier.

**Thoughts:** I read [this article](https://www.colbyfayock.com/2020/06/how-to-grow-your-audience-and-share-your-content-with-the-world) by [Colby Fayock](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock) and took his advice on joining DEV to share my content, I also learned I can add a canonical link to the DEV article so my website's blog can get the DEV "SEO juice".

### Day 21: June 15, 2020
##### Updated some website bits & published articles to [DEV.to](https://dev.to/jackdomleo7)

**Today's Progress**: Added the DEV icon and a 'Buy Me a Coffee' button to my website's footer. Created a new Twitter & LinkedIn banner. Published other existing articles from [jackdomleo.dev/blog](https://jackdomleo.dev/blog) to [DEV.to](https://dev.to/jackdomleo7).

**Thoughts:** I've had a tough fair few days battling Nuxt Content, I thought I'd take it easy today and do some little neat enjoyables tasks!

### Day 22: June 16, 2020
##### Added front-end fuzzy search to my blog page

**Today's Progress**: Using the same helper method for front-end fuzzy searching on my projects page, I decided to also add it to my blog page to make it easier (primarily for me) to find articles.

**Thoughts:** I love little tasks like these, so fun! You can filter by title, description, date, reading time and hashtags!

### Day 23: June 17, 2020
##### Taking it easy...

**Today's Progress**: Took things slower today, gave myself time to think. I spent a lot of time reorganising my structure and approach to development. I signed up to Evernote for better and cleaner note taking. I also created rules for my emails so they'd go into certain folders because they were getting a bit too much. Made more progress on my article about my journey to being a developer. Read the first chapter of "Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS" by Ben Frain and began writing my review on it.

**Thoughts:** Feel like I'm nearing burnout. So much on my plate right now. All my coding related tasks are jumbled; I keep jumping between tasks because I don't know what to prioritise and I was becoming overwhelming. Not to mention my sudden popularity on Twitter and CodePen with the pressure that I feel I have to deliver.
