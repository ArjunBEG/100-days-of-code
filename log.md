### Day 1: May 26, 2020
##### Vue `<transition>` as part of a CodePen challenge

**Today's Progress**: Participated in the 4th part of CodePen's May 2020 challenge, [Vue Transitions](https://codepen.io/challenges/2020/may/4), so created an Alan Sugar firing list.

**Thoughts:** I only really know as much as CSS transitions and keyframes. I'd really like to learn more web animation but not sure where to start. Check out my [tweet](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1265052767850237954). But this was a good first insight into Vue transitions and it was also nice that I'm already familiar with Vue.js.
