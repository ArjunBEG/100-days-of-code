# 100 Days Of Code - Log - [Jack Domleo](https://jackdomleo.dev)

### Day 1: May 26, 2020
##### Vue `<transition>` as part of a CodePen challenge

**Today's Progress**: Participated in the 4th part of CodePen's May 2020 challenge, [Vue Transitions](https://codepen.io/challenges/2020/may/4), so created an Alan Sugar firing list.

**Thoughts:** I only really know as much as CSS transitions and keyframes. I'd really like to learn more web animation but not sure where to start. Check out my [tweet](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1265052767850237954). But this was a good first insight into Vue transitions and it was also nice that I'm already familiar with Vue.js.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020
##### Neumorphic Design

**Today's Progress**: I've recently been fascinated with neumorphic design, so I went and learned how to create neumorpic components.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed doing this. I created several CodePen pens and I wrote a blog to further my understanding. Even though neumorphic design never really took off, I probably won't use or recommend it commercially, however I will definitely use it when creating little neat CodePens.

### Day 3: May 28, 2020
##### Union Jack flag and learning anime.js

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a little CodePen of the Union Jack flag and start learning anime.js

**Thoughts:** The Union Jack flag was interesting because it allowed me to think of how the flag should be structured. I ultimtaely ended up using simple blocks for the red England flag, then furthering my understanding of `linear-gradient` with the Scottish and St George flag. I also began learning anime.js for web animation which I hope to be continuing for 4-5 days.
