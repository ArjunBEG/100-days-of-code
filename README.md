### Day 1: May 26, 2020
##### Vue `<transition>` as part of a CodePen challenge

**Today's Progress**: Participated in the 4th part of CodePen's May 2020 challenge, [Vue Transitions](https://codepen.io/challenges/2020/may/4), so created an Alan Sugar firing list.

**Thoughts:** I only really know as much as CSS transitions and keyframes. I'd really like to learn more web animation but not sure where to start. Check out my [tweet](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1265052767850237954). But this was a good first insight into Vue transitions and it was also nice that I'm already familiar with Vue.js.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020
##### Neumorphic Design

**Today's Progress**: I've recently been fascinated with neumorphic design, so I went and learned how to create neumorpic components.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed doing this. I created several CodePen pens and I wrote a blog to further my understanding. Even though neumorphic design never really took off, I probably won't use or recommend it commercially, however I will definitely use it when creating little neat CodePens.

### Day 3: May 28, 2020
##### Union Jack flag and learning anime.js

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a little CodePen of the Union Jack flag and start learning anime.js

**Thoughts:** The Union Jack flag was interesting because it allowed me to think of how the flag should be structured. I ultimtaely ended up using simple blocks for the red England flag, then furthering my understanding of `linear-gradient` with the Scottish and Northern Ireland flag. I also began learning anime.js for web animation which I hope to be continuing for 4-5 days.

### Day 4: May 29, 2020
##### Web animation - anime.js and GSAP

**Today's Progress**: I began learning anime.js yesterday and sadly we did not get on, so I started over with GSAP

**Thoughts:** Learning GSAP was really fun, I began by making a simple spinning smiley face animation on CodePen. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong with myself and anime.js but hopefully I can revisit it later and try again. But for now, I'm impressed with GSAP! I was curious as to whether other people preferred anime.js or GSAP, so I created a [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1266140324767899648).

### Day 5: May 30, 2020
##### Web animation - GSAP

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with GSAP today, a little lost on ideas and felt a bit demotivated

**Thoughts:** I've been struggling with web animation to be honest, in the sense of - I feel idealess, had a few 'gotcha' moments with timing, messy JS and just feeling like I'm in the right vibe for web animation, it's more of a designer job. Anywho, I'm determined to carry on because I am genuinely interested in learning more and improving my web animation skills.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020
##### Web animation - GSAP

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Day/Night GSAP animation, wasn't particularly happy with myself

**Thoughts:** I've been feeling a bit deflated with my progression on web animation. I wasn't happy with where my skills were. I had to remind myself that it's OK, it will take time, I just need to keep creating lots of animations and eventually my understanding will get there, a very similar approach to how I learned CSS. I've decided to take a little break from web animation and move onto to something else and revisit it in a week or two, hopefully in that time I may discover some free courses and/or more inspirational ideas.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020
##### Neumorphic design

**Today's Progress**: Resumed on my neumorphic design CodePen and collection

**Thoughts:** I decided to take a break from animation today and focus on a few more neumorphic element ideas of mine. I created an analogue and digital clock and various loaders. Looking to resume animation tomorrow with the new CodePen challenge on GSAP.

### Day 8: June 2, 2020
##### GSAP Sequencing Animation

**Today's Progress**: Revisted web animation with CodePen's GSAP Sequencing challenge and watched animation tutorials

**Thoughts:** Interesting day. Took the opportunity to look at what others had submitted for their GSAP sequencing animation CodePen challenge, which inspired me to revisit animation ealrier than expected. Watched a few tutorials on GSAP, reading documentation is OK, but watching a tutorial, watching someone actually do is where it's at! Started an airplane CodePen animation that I hope to resume tomorrow with new things I've learned.
